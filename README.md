What is Digital Signal Processing?
- Digital signal processing (DSP) is the process of analyzing and modifying a signal to optimize or improve its efficiency or performance. It involves applying various mathematical and computational algorithms to analog and digital signals to produce a signal that's of higher quality than the original signal.

-  DSP is primarily used to detect errors, and to filter and compress analog signals in transit. It is a type of signal processing performed through a digital signal processor or a similarly capable device that can execute DSP specific processing algorithms. Typically, DSP first converts an analog signal into a digital signal and then applies signal processing techniques and algorithms. For example, when performed on audio signals, DSP helps reduce noise and distortion. Some of the applications of DSP include audio signal processing, digital image processing, speech recognition, biomedicine and more.
